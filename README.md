| Team Ceruledge | Nanded | SGGS College | Abstract Our platform is an end-to-end autonomous pharmacy ecosystem designed to transform traditional pharmaceutical services into a proactive, intelligent healthcare experience. At its core, the system utilizes a multi-agent orchestration framework (LangGraph & LangChain) powered by Python-based NLP and OCR to simulate a human pharmacist’s reasoning. The system integrates voice and-text conversational Chatbot with automated prescription validation, real-time inventory synchronization, and a personalized medication adherence engine. Unlike traditional platforms, our platform acts autonomously, it notifies pharmacists of new requests, validates safety protocols, predicts exact refill dates, and even learns a user’s daily routine to provide hyper-personalized medication reminders, all while ensuring 100% observability through LangSmith. The workflow begins with a voice or text-based consultation. Users can speak naturally to the Chatbot, which uses NLP to extract dosages and quantities. Simultaneously, an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) pipeline parses uploaded physical prescriptions. The system cross references the extracted text with the image data to ensure 100% accuracy and regulatory compliance before a single order is processed. Using LangGraph, the system manages complex, stateful workflows. If a user requests a medicine, the platform doesn't just check a database, it autonomously verifies safety protocols, checks contraindications, and validates the prescription's expiration. This "Chain of Thought" is logged via LangSmith, providing the transparency and auditability required by modern healthcare standards. The system functions as a digital health guardian by tracking Customer Purchase History. By calculating the daily dosage against the quantity purchased, our platform estimates the exact date a user will run out of medication. It then proactively sends a notification to the user and allows "one-click reorder" and alerts the pharmacist if the any item falls below buffer stock levels, ensuring the supply chain never breaks. Beyond ordering, the platform acts as a personalized health coach. By cross-referencing doctor-prescribed frequencies (e.g., "twice daily after meals") with user-provided routine data (e.g., typical lunch/dinner times), the platform autonomously predicts the optimal window for notifications. It doesn't just send a generic alert it analyzes the medicine's specific requirements to remind the user when to eat, and subsequently, when to take their medication, ensuring maximum efficiency and safety. |  |  |

| Team Shiftry | Amravati | prof.ram meghe institute of technology and reserach,badnera | We are team "Sproud". We proposed the abstract for problem statement that is PharmaGenie: An Autonomous Agentic AI for Smart Pharmacies Traditional pharmacy systems rely heavily on manual search-and-click workflows, fragmented inventory checks, and reactive refill processes, resulting in operational inefficiencies, medication delays, and increased risk of compliance violations. To address these challenges, we propose PharmaGenie, an end-to-end Agentic AI–driven pharmacy automation platform that transforms conventional digital pharmacies into a proactive, safety-aware, self-executing ecosystem. PharmaGenie is designed to behave like a virtual expert pharmacist capable of understanding free-form voice and text conversations, validating prescriptions, forecasting refill requirements, and autonomously orchestrating backend workflows with minimal human intervention. The system leverages a multi-agent architecture where specialized agents collaborate—such as a Conversation Agent for intent extraction, a Safety & Policy Agent for regulatory checks, a Forecasting Agent for refill prediction, and an Operations Agent for inventory updates and warehouse triggers—while remaining fully traceable through integrated observability tooling. The conversational layer uses natural-language parsing and speech-to-text pipelines to extract medicine names, dosages, and quantities from unstructured dialogue, even in ambiguous or colloquial phrasing. Orders are validated in real time against a centralized Medicine Master dataset that acts as the system’s single source of truth, ensuring prescription-required drugs are blocked unless proper authorization exists and that stock availability is enforced before checkout. To move beyond reactive workflows, PharmaGenie incorporates predictive intelligence over historical customer purchase data to identify patients approaching depletion cycles and automatically initiates refill conversations or alerts through chat, email, or WhatsApp channels. This proactive intervention reduces missed doses, improves medication adherence, and optimizes stock turnover. A lightweight but functional UI provides both a customer-facing chat/voice interface and an admin dashboard visualizing live inventory levels, agent decisions, and proactive refill triggers. On the backend, a mock microservice architecture built with FastAPI or Node.js exposes APIs for inventory, orders, and customer history, which agents invoke directly to write transactions and trigger webhook-based warehouse fulfillment flows. Crucially, PharmaGenie embeds full agent observability through platforms such as Langfuse or LangSmith, allowing judges to inspect cross-agent communication, reasoning paths, and approval or rejection decisions—ensuring transparency, auditability, and regulatory readiness. This project demonstrates how agentic systems can safely automate healthcare commerce at scale by combining conversational AI, rule-based governance, predictive analytics, and real-world action pipelines. PharmaGenie is architected for extensibility toward real pharmacies, insurance verification, electronic prescription ingestion, and multi-store inventory optimization, positioning it as a practical blueprint for the next generation of autonomous healthcare platforms.

| Team Sharpedo | Pune | Pimpri Chinchwad College of Engineering and Research | GoMed - Continuity is the cure. The pharmaceutical industry has advanced in areas such as digital inventory systems, and online medicine delivery. However, most pharmacy workflows remain transactional and event driven, focusing on dispensing medicines rather than monitoring whether prescribed therapies are actually followed. After a prescription is fulfilled, patient adherence, therapy continuation, and real-world medication usage are rarely tracked, leading to missed doses, unsafe refills, and silent treatment failure especially in long term therapies for chronic conditions like Diabetes, etc. A key limitation of current systems is their reliance on static, time based refill schedules and rule based checks. These approaches fail to incorporate behavioral signals such as missed medication intake, irregular refill patterns, or prolonged patient inactivity. The period between doctor visits remains largely unmonitored, even though it is the most critical phase for therapy breakdown. Patient silence is often misinterpreted as compliance, resulting in delayed intervention and reduced healthcare efficiency. GoMed addresses this gap by introducing an autonomous, agentic AI based system focused on ensuring continuity of medication therapy. Instead of reacting only to explicit user requests, GoMed continuously reasons over patient interaction signals, adherence confirmations, refill history, therapy duration, and silence patterns. Using temporal reasoning, the system evaluates how therapy is progressing over time and proactively identifies risks before treatment failure occurs. The system is built on a multi-agent architecture, where each agent performs a specialized role. A conversational AI agent leverages large language model (LLM) capabilities to process unstructured patient input. The core therapy continuity agent analyzes adherence trends, therapy trajectories, and remaining medication estimates to classify therapy states as stable, drifting, critical, or completed. Safety and policy agents enforce prescription compliance and prevent unsafe refills, while inventory agents ensure operational feasibility. An action agent autonomously executes backend workflows such as refill initiation, appointment recommendations, and notification delivery. All inter agent decisions are logged through an observability layer, enabling explainable AI behavior and full traceability. By transitioning from static, time driven workflows to behavior aware and context sensitive intelligence, GoMed is expected to improve medication adherence by 25-30%, reduce missed or delayed refills by approximately 20%, and increase overall pharmacy operational efficiency by 30-35% through automation and early intervention. On a broader scale, GoMed supports preventive healthcare, reduces avoidable treatment failures, and demonstrates how agentic AI can be responsibly applied to improve real world healthcare outcomes.

Voice and text inputs are processed through a lightweight natural language understanding layer to extract intents, entities, and confidence scores. Planning is handled by a rule-first decision layer that deterministically enforces prescription requirements, stock availability, and ordering policies using structured medicine and inventory data as the system’s single source of truth. Large language models are invoked only when ambiguity or multi-step reasoning is required, preventing over-reliance on probabilistic decisions for safety-critical actions. Multiple backend agents coordinate to execute end-to-end workflows, including cart creation, prescription verification, refill prediction from historical consumption patterns, and automated fulfillment triggers via APIs or webhooks. The system incorporates fast-path routing for common interactions, selective caching, and parallelized non-blocking checks to minimize response latency while maintaining correctness. Full observability is integrated across agents and tool calls, enabling traceable decision flows and post-hoc analysis. Offline evaluation using retrieval-grounded metrics is employed to validate factual grounding and regression safety without impacting runtime performance. | [Link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1p3vh21riDRy1k68KrzHi2lhlsmai8bPA/view?usp=drivesdk) |  |

| Team Krookodile | Nanded | MGM's College Of Engineering,  And Matoshri Pratishthan's Vishwabharti Polytechnic Nanded | Traditional pharmacy systems follow a manual, search and click workflow that depends heavily on human decision making for order validation, inventory checks, refill reminders, and compliance enforcement. Such systems are reactive, inefficient, and prone to human error, especially in regulated healthcare environments. This project presents an On-Premise Agentic AI Pharmacy System that transforms a conventional pharmacy into an autonomous and intelligent ecosystem. The system is powered by LLaMA 3.2 running entirely on premise, orchestrated through LangChain based agent workflows, and integrated with a MySQL backed backend that serves as the single source of truth. Unlike typical chatbot solutions, the proposed system behaves like an expert pharmacist. It understands natural text and voice conversations, enforces prescription and stock policies using structured medicine data, predicts medicine refill requirements based on historical consumption, and autonomously executes backend operations such as order creation, inventory updates, and warehouse notifications. The platform is fully containerized using Docker and incorporates Langfuse observability to provide complete traceability of agent decisions, inter agent communication, and tool execution. The result is a privacy preserving, explainable, and production ready agentic AI system suitable for real world pharmacy operations. https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QncQt4tzCKOZXez9pzTc8YGA-IwFm0zk/view?usp=sharing | [Link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QncQt4tzCKOZXez9pzTc8YGA-IwFm0zk/view?usp=sharing) |  |
| Team Gholdengo | NAGPUR | ST VINCENT PALLOTTI COLLEGE OF ENGINEERING AND TECHNOLOGY | An abstract in one strong paragraph, following your sequence: Digital pharmacies increasingly use AI for prescription refills, but most current systems are transactional, rule‑based, and fail to behave like a safe, expert pharmacist. They have shallow medical reasoning, limited safety checks, weak support for messy multilingual conversations, and poor transparency of decisions, leaving a gap for an agentic, clinically aware solution. This work aims to build an AI‑driven pharmacist that supports natural voice/text ordering, enforces medicine and prescription safety, predicts individual refill needs, and autonomously drives backend operations with minimal human intervention. We design a multi‑agent architecture over a custom pharmacy backend, combining LLM‑based conversational understanding, rules for safety and misuse detection, data‑driven refill prediction, and automated API/webhook actions, all monitored through a dedicated observability layer. Initial evaluations show that the system can robustly parse real‑world dialogues, block or escalate unsafe refills, trigger timely, personalized refill prompts, and keep inventory and fulfilment flows in sync with clear, auditable traces. These results indicate that an agentic, safety‑first AI pharmacist can transform a traditional search‑and‑click pharmacy into an autonomous, patient‑centric ecosystem.

After secure login, patients access an **“Expert Pharmacy”** assistant instead of a generic chatbot. The agent behaves like a senior clinical pharmacist: it gathers structured context (age, comorbidities, ongoing medications, allergies), reads the patient’s existing records, and uses a medicine master database as the strict source of truth for stock levels and prescription requirements. It then delivers explainable recommendations on drugs, doses, duration, interactions, and monitoring, with clear escalation to human doctors for high‑risk cases. Under the hood, the system is built as an **agentic, tool‑using architecture**. A Gemini‑powered pharmacist agent orchestrates calls to a FastAPI + Supabase backend that hosts medicines, orders, refill alerts, and notification logs. Instead of hallucinating, the agent must call tools to read inventory, check a patient’s order history, create/finalize orders, trigger a mock warehouse webhook, and send confirmations over WhatsApp and email, satisfying the “real‑world action” requirement. Predictive intelligence jobs analyse historical purchase and dosing data to forecast when chronic medications will run out and automatically initiate proactive refill conversations or alerts. The frontend is a **clinical, trust‑oriented chat and voice interface** embedded in the existing MyHealthChain dashboard: the primary CTAs are “Talk to Pharmacist” and “Upload Prescription”, and ordering is offered only after a clear, safe recommendation. An admin view exposes live inventory, low‑stock signals, and generated refill alerts, showcasing the autonomous behaviour of the agent. All LLM and tool interactions are traced via Langfuse, giving judges and clinicians full observability into how the pharmacist agent reasoned, which tools it called, and why it approved or rejected an order, as mandated by the problem statement. | [Link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PUKpVkERvp667Y3R7cFC_MszU6fhHzdj/view?usp=sharing) |  |
| Team Milotic | Nashik | Sandip Institute of Technology and Research Center | ABSTRACT This system implements an agentic pharmacy ordering and refill platform using a strict separation between medical intelligence, application orchestration, and execution layers, designed for safety-critical and high-concurrency environments. A dedicated FastAPI-based medical intelligence microservice integrates a Gemini large language model (LLM) to perform natural-language medicine understanding. The LLM extracts structured order intent from unstructured human input, including medicine name, quantity, unit, and user intent, while assigning a confidence score to each extraction. The output is normalized into a deterministic schema, for example: { "medicine_name": "Dolo 650", "quantity": 2, "unit": "strip", "quantity_converted": 20, "operation": "decrease", "confidence": 0.94 } FastAPI applies unit conversion logic to transform human expressions such as “1 strip”, “half bottle”, or “2 tablets” into canonical quantities (e.g., tablets or millilitres). It then enforces medical safety and stock validation rules, including maximum allowable quantity per user, prescription-only medicine checks, expiry validation, and blocking unsafe or abnormal orders. All medical decisions are returned as deterministic approvals or structured errors (e.g., "Paracetamol max limit is 20 tablets"), ensuring that no medical logic resides outside this service. A Node.js backend acts as the application and orchestration layer, managing authentication (login, OTP/password, JWT tokens), user roles (admin and customer), cart logic, order creation, order history, payment state, and inventory updates. Node.js routes requests to FastAPI for validation, persists only approved outcomes, and controls stock mutations to avoid race conditions. Its non-blocking architecture enables high-concurrency mobile usage and seamless integration with React Native clients. The system supports pre-prepared refill orders, where medically validated orders are staged in advance before user confirmation, enabling autonomous action with explicit user control. Upon confirmation, Node.js triggers warehouse fulfilment through internal APIs and manages all real-world side effects, including push notifications (FCM), SMS, and email delivery. FastAPI is intentionally isolated from notification handling and external workflow orchestration, serving exclusively as the medical language understanding and validation service. Full agent observability is implemented using LangSmith, capturing every Gemini LLM parsing request, unit conversion result, safety decision, and execution outcome. This provides end-to-end traceability, early detection of AI extraction errors (critical in medical contexts), and monitoring of token usage and latency. The resulting system demonstrates a production-aligned, auditable, and safety-first application of agentic AI for pharmacy operations, prioritizing deterministic medical enforcement over conversational convenience.

People speak informally, mix languages, rely on memory (“same as last time”), and operate under time pressure. This project upgrades existing pharmacy workflows by adding decision-aware intelligence on top of proven systems, without compromising their reliability . Users can identify medicines by typing, speaking, or uploading images of medicine strips. The system progressively derives intent from ambiguous or incomplete input, confirming only when necessary and avoiding unnecessary follow-up questions. Conversational understanding is treated as a continuous process rather than a one-time interpretation. User history is used to build lightweight profiles that capture medication usage patterns such as chronic versus short-term treatments, refill behavior, and confidence levels. These signals enable context-aware refill assistance, inventory-aware prediction, and season-sensitive alerts that activate only when they are genuinely useful. Safety is enforced deterministically using a structured medicine dataset as the single source of truth. The system distinguishes between hard blocks, such as missing prescriptions, and soft constraints, such as partial stock or unusual quantities, allowing negotiation and alternatives instead of rejection. Once intent is resolved and constraints are satisfied, the system executes , creating orders, updating inventory, triggering workflows, and logging every action. By focusing on decision-making before execution, this system demonstrates a practical, human-centered evolution of online pharmacy automation. | [Link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vzghUpNKbSIvLmBxMk05rgXM0QZ0M2e5/view?usp=drive_link) |  |

| Team Rapidash | Nanded | Gramin Technical And Management Campus | ABSTRACT TOPIC :- PHARMASYNC AI – AN AUTONOMOUS AGENTIC PHARMACY ECOSYSTEM Traditional pharmacy systems are limited by manual searches and rigid interfaces. PharmaSync AI transforms this experience by building an Autonomous Agentic AI System that functions as an expert pharmacist. Unlike standard apps, this system uses advanced Agentic Capabilities to handle end-to-end pharmacy operations with minimal human intervention. The system is built on a Multi-Agent Architecture consisting of two primary interfaces: Intelligent Patient Interface: A natural voice and text-based interface that uses LLMs to extract medicine names, dosages, and quantities from complex, human-like dialogue. It features Predictive Intelligence that proactively analyzes historical consumer data to identify upcoming refills and initiate automated conversations with patients before their medicine runs out. Autonomous Admin & Safety Hub: This panel acts as the "Source of Truth," enforcing strict safety policies based on real-time inventory and "Prescription Required" flags. The agents autonomously execute backend tasks, such as updating mock databases, triggering warehouse webhooks (n8n/Zapier), and sending automated order confirmations via WhatsApp/Email. A critical feature of PharmaSync AI is its Traceable Reasoning.

| Team Giratina | Pusad | Babasaheb Naik College of Engineering Pusad | Medication non-adherence and dispensing errors continue to pose serious challenges in healthcare, leading to poor patient outcomes and increased operational costs. Despite growing digitization, most pharmacy platforms remain limited to reactive, transactional, search-based workflows that lack clinical reasoning, robust safety validation, and proactive patient engagement. PharmAgent presents a cognitive Agentic AI system built on a hierarchical multi-agent architecture, designed to mirror expert pharmacist decision-making through autonomous reasoning and controlled execution. Specialized agents collaboratively handle conversational understanding, safety validation, predictive intelligence, and backend execution enabling the system to transition pharmacy operations from reactive dispensing to proactive, policy-driven care. A conversational Ordering Agent leverages multimodal natural language understanding to interpret messy voice/text inputs, extract medication entities, dosages, and quantities, and resolve ambiguous requests. All actions are validated against a Medicine Master Dataset acting as the system’s single Source of Truth, ensuring strict enforcement of prescription requirements, stock availability, and safety policies. A dedicated Safety Agent applies constraint-aware, system-2 reasoning and prioritizes explicit decision deferral and escalation in safety-critical scenarios rather than probabilistic inference. Beyond reactive fulfillment, a Predictive Intelligence Agent analyzes historical consumption patterns to estimate end-of-supply timelines and proactively initiate refill or procurement workflows before medication stock-out occurs. Upon successful clinical and policy validation, the system demonstrates end-to-end agency by autonomously executing real-world actions such as order approval, inventory updates, and triggering mock supplier or fulfillment workflows via APIs and webhooks. All agent decisions and interactions are captured through a mandatory observability and decision-tracing layer, providing transparent auditability, explainability, and regulatory oversight into how and why each decision was made. Through this architecture, PharmAgent demonstrates how agentic AI can enhance medication safety, improve adherence, and scale reliable, autonomous pharmaceutical care delivery. |  |  |

| Team Onix | vishnupuri,nanded | shri guru gobind singh ji institute of engineering and technology | In this project, we are building an Agentic AI based Smart Pharmacy system that makes medicine ordering more simple and intelligent compared to the traditional search and click method. The system behaves like a virtual pharmacist and can understand natural text conversations where users may not give perfect inputs. Based on the medicine inventory data, the system automatically checks stock availability and prescription requirements before allowing an order. It also uses previous customer order history to predict when a user may need a refill and proactively sends reminders. Once an order is confirmed, the system updates the backend inventory and triggers a mock warehouse fulfillment and order confirmation. The complete decision process of the agent is traceable using an observability layer to show how and why each decision is taken. |  |  |
| Team Jigglypuff | Mumbai | Government Polytechnic , Mumbai | Current pharmacy workflows are largely manual and reactive, relying on keyword-based searches and human intervention for inventory checks, prescription validation, and order handling. These limitations often result in inefficiencies, delays, and operational errors. This project proposes AI Pharmacist, an agentic artificial intelligence system designed to autonomously manage pharmacy operations through intelligent decision-making and structured execution. The system functions as a virtual pharmacist that communicates with users using natural language, understands unstructured medicine requests, and converts them into well-defined operational inputs such as medicine identity, dosage, and quantity. Instead of generating free-form responses, all interactions are processed through a controlled execution pipeline that prioritizes safety, accuracy, and regulatory compliance. At the core of the system lies a centralized medicine knowledge base that acts as the authoritative source for stock levels, unit definitions, and prescription requirements. Every user request is evaluated by a policy enforcement mechanism that ensures medicines are dispensed only when all constraints are satisfied. If a requested item is unavailable or restricted, the system provides a transparent explanation and suggests suitable over-the-counter alternatives when permitted. The architecture follows an agent-based design, where specialized agents collaborate to perform distinct roles, including conversational understanding, policy validation, predictive refill analysis, and execution of real-world actions such as order placement, inventory updates, and fulfillment notifications. By integrating conversational intelligence with autonomous execution and strict policy controls, AI Pharmacist demonstrates a practical application of agentic AI in healthcare operations. The system reduces dependency on manual effort, minimizes dispensing errors, and improves inventory planning while maintaining full traceability of decisions through system logs. This approach highlights how intelligent agent-based systems can transform traditional pharmacy management into a scalable, transparent, and efficient healthcare solution.

| Team Mew | Nanded | Shri Guru Gobind Singhji Institute of Engineering and Technology | Digital pharmacy systems today are largely reactive, fragile, and poorly equipped to handle real-world ambiguity, adversarial inputs, and medical safety risks. In high-stakes healthcare contexts, failures caused by noisy voice input, ambiguous user intent, or system hallucination can directly compromise patient safety. This project presents an Agentic AI–powered Autonomous Pharmacy System designed not only for functional correctness, but for robustness under adversarial and edge-case conditions, as expected in real clinical environments. The system employs a multi-agent architecture in which specialized agents—Pharmacist, Safety & Compliance Officer, and Fulfillment Manager—operate under strict separation of concerns. Conversational input, including imperfect or voice-transcribed language, is normalized through fuzzy matching and semantic retrieval to accurately map user intent to verified medicines in a deterministic backend. The AI is explicitly prevented from guessing stock availability, dosage, or prescription validity; all such decisions are enforced exclusively through database-backed validation tools and hard safety constraints. To address real-world conversational failures, the system incorporates safeguards against common voice and language edge cases, including misheard medicine names, incomplete quantity requests, and mixed-language input. The system is designed to ask clarifying questions when required information is missing, refuse unsafe or manipulative requests regardless of user claims, and escalate potential medical emergencies—such as chest pain or breathing difficulty—by halting commerce and directing users to immediate clinical care. Operational robustness is further ensured through transactional database constraints that prevent race conditions during concurrent orders, guaranteeing inventory consistency under simultaneous access. Predictive intelligence is implemented via the Proportion of Days Covered (PDC) algorithm to proactively identify refill risks and initiate outreach before medication depletion occurs. A core differentiator of the system is its emphasis on observability and transparency. Every agent decision, safety check, and tool invocation is fully traceable through an integrated observability layer, enabling administrators and evaluators to inspect the system’s reasoning paths in real time. An admin interface exposes inventory state, rejected orders, and audit logs, transforming potential failure scenarios into demonstrable safety features. By combining agentic reasoning, deterministic safety enforcement, proactive intelligence, and explicit edge-case defense mechanisms, this system demonstrates how autonomous AI agents can operate reliably, safely, and transparently in healthcare-critical environments—moving beyond scripted chatbots toward genuinely trustworthy digital pharmacy systems. |  |  |
| Team Golem | Amravati | Prof. Ram Meghe Institute of Technology & Research Badnera | In today’s digital pharmacies, users still rely heavily on manual search, repeated refills, and human verification for safety checks. Our project, Autonomous Agentic Pharmacy System, reimagines this experience by introducing an AI-driven pharmacist that can understand, decide, and act independently—just like a real expert. This system allows users to order medicines through natural text or voice conversations, even when the input is informal or unstructured. The AI intelligently extracts medicine names, dosage, and quantity, validates them against a verified medicine database, and processes orders end-to-end without human intervention. Safety is treated as a first-class priority. The system strictly enforces medical policies by checking stock availability and prescription requirements using a trusted medicine master dataset. If a prescription is missing, the AI autonomously blocks the order and clearly explains the reason to the user, ensuring compliance and responsible dispensing. Going beyond reactive behavior, the platform demonstrates predictive intelligence by analyzing customer purchase history to anticipate when a user is about to run out of essential medicines. It proactively initiates refill alerts and conversations, improving adherence and user convenience. To ensure transparency and trust, every decision made by the AI is fully traceable using agentic observability tools like Langfuse or LangSmith. Judges can view detailed logs showing how the AI reasoned, interacted with backend systems, and arrived at each decision. The solution includes a chat-based customer interface and a lightweight admin dashboard for monitoring inventory and proactive alerts, backed by a custom mock API for real-world workflow simulation. In essence, this project showcases how agentic AI can transform a traditional pharmacy into a safe, intelligent, and autonomous healthcare assistant, setting a foundation for future AI-driven healthcare systems. |  |  |

The Problem: Ordering medicine online today is complicated. Most apps require users to type correct English spellings (e.g., "Acetaminophen"), which is difficult for millions of people in India who speak local languages or are not tech-savvy. Furthermore, current chatbots are "dumb"—they cannot verify if a doctor’s prescription is valid, leading to the unsafe sale of restricted drugs (like antibiotics or sleeping pills). Finally, patients often forget to buy their daily medicines on time, leading to health risks. 2. Our Solution: MedBotix is not just a chatbot; it is a Smart Pharmacist. Think of it as a friendly human pharmacist who lives in your phone. • It Listens: You don’t need to type. Just say "Mujhe bukhar hai" (I have a fever) in Hinglish, and it understands. • It Sees: You can upload a photo of a handwritten doctor’s prescription, and the AI reads it instantly to verify the medicines. • It Acts: It checks stock, calculates the price, and sends the order directly to the warehouse without any human help. 3. How It Works (Our Approach): We built MedBotix using the latest Agentic AI technology (AI that takes action, not just talks). • The Brain (Gen AI): Powered by Gemini, the bot understands mixed languages (Hindi + English) and medical slang. • The Eyes (Computer Vision): When a user asks for a restricted medicine (like Tramadol), the bot automatically switches to "Safety Mode." It asks for a prescription image, scans it using AI, and only allows the order if the doctor’s note is valid. • The Memory (Predictive ML): We use a Machine Learning engine to analyse a patient's history. If a diabetic patient bought insulin 25 days ago, the bot intelligently predicts they will run out in 5 days and sends a proactive reminder to refill. • The Hands (Warehouse Integration): Once an order is confirmed, the bot triggers a Webhook to our backend system, simulating a real-time dispatch process. 4. Unique Features: • True Multimodal Interaction: We combine Voice (Speech-to-Text) and Vision (Image Scanning) in one seamless chat flow. • Safety-First Architecture: Unlike other bots that just sell anything, MedBotix has a "conscience." It strictly blocks illegal sales of prescription drugs without proof. • No App Learning Curve: If you can talk to a person, you can use MedBotix. It brings e-pharmacy access to rural villages and elderly users. 5. Expected Outcomes & Impact: • For Patients: Medicine becomes accessible to everyone, regardless of language or literacy. No more missed doses due to our predictive reminders. • For Pharmacy Owners: Automation reduces manual work, and the AI ensures 100% legal compliance by verifying prescriptions automatically. • For Society: Reduces the risk of drug abuse and self-medication by enforcing safety checks at the AI level. Key Technologies Used: • AI Model: Google LLM (for speed and intelligence). • Orchestration: LangGraph (to manage the AI's decision-making flow). • Frontend: Streamlit (for the Voice & Chat interface). • Backend: FastAPI & ML(for warehouse logic and machine learning). | [Link](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1DTF1rcPj7kDub_s3yE4ggJl2QfmVV_9J/edit?usp=drivesdk&ouid=112906043156096523707&rtpof=true&sd=true) | The Problem: \| Our Solution: \| It Listens: You don’t need to type.

| Team Zamazenta | NANDED | MGM COLLEGE OF ENG NANDED | MediSync A Unified Digital Platform for Smart Healthcare Coordination Introduction Healthcare at the local level still depends heavily on manual coordination between patients, doctors, chemists, and suppliers. While doctors provide correct medical decisions, the real challenges begin after the consultation—during prescription handling, medicine availability, refill scheduling, and pharmacy stock management. Many patients struggle to understand handwritten prescriptions, chronic patients miss refills, chemists face difficulty tracking inventory, and suppliers receive sudden orders without preparation. These gaps create delays, confusion, wastage, and inefficiency in the healthcare chain. **MediSync** is a role-based digital platform designed to connect **Patients, Doctors, Chemists, and Suppliers** into one coordinated ecosystem. It focuses on automation of healthcare operations—not diagnosis—ensuring safety, trust, and real-world feasibility. The goal of MediSync is to ensure that: * Patients receive medicines on time * Prescriptions are clear, reusable, and accessible * Chemists can manage stock efficiently * Suppliers can plan and deliver proactively Problem Healthcare systems suffer from major inefficiencies after a prescription is written. The process of interpreting prescriptions, finding medicine availability, managing refills, tracking pharmacy stock, and coordinating suppliers is still mostly manual and disconnected. There is no unified system that can digitally connect all stakeholders and automate medicine workflows while maintaining safety and privacy. This leads to prescription confusion, missed refills, medicine unavailability, stock shortages, wastage, and delayed treatment. Problems Faced by Patients A. Prescription Handling Problems Handwritten prescriptions are often: * Difficult to read * Misinterpreted by patients or chemists Patients struggle to: * Understand medicine names * Follow correct dosage schedules Prescriptions are: * Easily lost * Not reusable across multiple pharmacies Chronic patients must repeatedly show the same prescription every month. If medicines are unavailable at one pharmacy, patients must search manually. Impact: Delayed treatment, wrong medicine intake, missed doses, confusion, and stress. B. Short-Term Patients (Fever, Cold, Minor Issues) Patients often face: * Confusion about safe OTC medicines * Risk of allergies and side effects * No structured guidance for symptoms * Delay in visiting doctors due to uncertainty Impact: Unsafe self-medication and slower recovery. C. Chronic Patients Long-term patients face: * Missed refill dates * Missed doses due to poor tracking * No automated refill support * Heavy dependence on manual reminders * Difficulty maintaining dosage schedules Impact: Poor treatment adherence and serious health complications. Problems Faced by Chemists (Medical Stores) Chemists deal with major operational challenges: * Inventory tracking is manual * Difficult to identify low-stock and fast-moving medicines * Monthly stock reconciliation is time-consuming * Missed sales due to unavailable medicines * Manual ordering decisions without forecasting * Lack of structured coordination with suppliers Impact: Revenue loss, inefficiency, customer dissatisfaction, and medicine wastage.

| Team Weavile | pune, Maharashtra | Rasiklal M Dhariwal Institute of Technology, Chinchwad | This project presents the design and development of an agentic AI system that transforms a traditional search-and-click pharmacy platform into an autonomous and intelligent ecosystem. While conventional e-pharmacy systems rely on natural language conversations using text and voice interfaces, the proposed system will undertake a proactive role as an expert AI pharmacist. The system utilizes multiple AI agents to perform specialized tasks, such as medicine extraction, safety and prescription checking, inventory management, and anticipation of refill requests. The system checks, without human input, whether the order can proceed based on its availability, checking of prescription requirements, and utilization of actual medicine master data and historical consumer purchase records as a single point of truth. A predictive intelligence module analyzes request frequency and purchase history to make proactive predictions and initiate proactive customer engagement. Real-world backend tasks update databases and start fulfillment in a warehouse through webhooks once validation is successful. There is a provision to include observability tools to allow traceability for decisions taken by the agents and communication between agents themselves. This project shows how a conversational AI system, policy enforcement mechanism, predictive analytics, and a workflow execution system can redefine digital healthcare commerce with agent-based architectures that are safer, more efficient, and easier to use with minimal human oversight. |  |  |
| Team Scizor | Chh. Sambhajinagar (Aurangabad) | G.S Mandal Maharashtra Institute Of Technology | PPT LINK :-https://pdflink.to/d33eb09b/ Abstract : - Most online pharmacy apps still work like search boxes. You type a medicine name, click a few buttons, and place an order. But real pharmacies don’t work that way. A pharmacist always looks at multiple things together — stock, safety rules, patient history, and what needs to happen next. We wanted our system to work the same way. Right now, users have to remember refills, understand prescription rules, and repeat the same steps every time they order. Even when safety checks exist, they are mostly hidden and reactive. If something goes wrong, neither the user nor the pharmacy clearly knows why an order was allowed or blocked. So instead of building another chatbot, we designed the system as a set of small AI agents that coordinate with each other. One agent focuses on understanding what the user wants from normal text or voice messages. Another checks stock levels and prescription rules using live data. A third decides whether the order should go ahead, wait, or ask the user for more clarity. No single agent takes the final decision alone, which helps avoid mistakes. The system also keeps working in the background. It looks at past orders and usage patterns to notice when a medicine is likely to run out. When that happens, it starts a refill conversation only if it’s actually needed, instead of sending constant reminders. Once an order is approved, the system doesn’t stop at conversation. It updates inventory, saves the order, and triggers fulfillment through mock APIs or webhooks. All decisions and agent interactions are logged, so it’s always clear what happened and why. Overall, this project shows how a pharmacy system can move away from manual, click-based workflows and behave more like a self-managing pharmacy, where decisions are safer, clearer, and easier to trust. |  |  |
| Team Snorlax | Chandwad | SNJB's Late Sau Kantabai Bhavarlalji Jain College of Engineering | Traditional online pharmacies depend on manual, search-based workflows and lack intelligent decision-making, contextual understanding, and automated safety enforcement. We are addressing this gap by introducing an Agentic AI–powered Autonomous Pharmacy Ecosystem that functions like a virtual expert pharmacist. The system is built using a modular multi-agent architecture consisting of a Conversational Agent (understands user text/voice input), Order Understanding Agent (identifies appropriate medicines using user history and descriptions), Policy & Safety Agent (checks prescription requirements and stock availability), Decision Agent (validates whether an order can proceed), and an Action Agent (executes real-world actions such as order placement, inventory updates, warehouse triggers, and notifications). Each agent has a single responsibility, enabling reliable orchestration, observability, and decision traceability. By separating AI reasoning from execution and enforcing deterministic safety rules, HackFusion delivers a scalable, auditable, and regulation-ready solution that transforms pharmacies into intelligent, autonomous healthcare systems.

| Team Gengar | Chh. Sambhaji Nagar | MIT Polytechnic | PharmaCo – AI-Powered Smart Emergency Pharmacy Ecosystem Imagine needing a critical medicine and getting it at your doorstep in under 15 minutes — safely, intelligently, and without stress. PharmaCo is an AI-driven digital pharmacy ecosystem designed to make urgent and routine medicine access faster, safer, and smarter. The system is built around three connected mobile applications — User App, Pharmacy Partner App, and Delivery Partner App — all powered by a single intelligent backend that maintains real-time inventory, ensures medical safety, and provides full transparency of every action. The PharmaCo User App acts as a personal AI health assistant. Users can order medicines using natural language typing or voice, upload prescriptions, or simply say “use my last prescription” to reorder previously prescribed medicines. The app securely stores medical history, running medicines, and past prescriptions, creating a personal health memory that helps avoid repeated uploads and reduces delays. PharmaCo also includes a home medicine inventory tracker, where users can record available tablets at home and receive smart refill reminders before medicines run out. If a required medicine is unavailable, PharmaCo’s AI Medicine Substitution feature suggests pharmacist-approved alternative brands with the same composition, ensuring treatment continuity. For urgent situations, PharmaCo introduces Emergency Mode. If a user shakes their phone, the system detects a possible emergency and asks for confirmation within 10 seconds. If the user confirms or does not respond, PharmaCo automatically alerts emergency contacts with the user’s live location and can prioritize emergency medicine delivery, helping users receive critical care faster. The Pharmacy Partner App allows medical stores to onboard, manage inventory in real time, verify prescriptions, and accept or decline incoming orders. When an order is placed, PharmaCo’s backend checks which pharmacies within a 5 km radius have the medicine in stock. Nearby pharmacies receive an instant alert, and once one pharmacy accepts the order, it becomes unavailable to others — ensuring fast and conflict-free fulfillment. The Delivery Partner App supports rapid last-mile logistics. Nearby delivery partners receive order alerts, and once a partner accepts, others cannot take the same job. Optimized route guidance ensures that medicines reach users as quickly as possible, supporting PharmaCo’s 15-minute delivery goal in high-density areas. At the core of PharmaCo is an AI orchestration layer powered by LangChain and OpenAI models, capable of converting messy voice or text input into structured medical orders. The AI extracts medicine names, dosages, and quantities from conversations and prescriptions, validates them against pharmacy inventory, and enforces medical safety rules. Prescription-only medicines are blocked from automatic dispatch and routed to pharmacists for verification. PharmaCo also maintains real-time system logs and AI decision traces, ensuring transparency, safety, and auditability. Every action — from user request to pharmacy confirmation to delivery assignment — is recorded, allowing judges and healthcare stakeholders to see exactly how decisions are made while protecting sensitive medical data. The technology stack prioritizes reliability and scalability: Flutter for cross-platform apps, Supabase for real-time database and backend operations, LangChain AI agents for intelligent order processing, and mapping services for route optimization. We will demonstrate four key flows: 1. 15-minute successful medicine delivery 2. Prescription upload and pharmacist verification 3. AI-based refill reminder and automatic reorder from past prescription 4. Emergency Mode with live location alert and priority medicine dispatch PharmaCo transforms medicine access into an intelligent, automated, and safety-first healthcare experience, combining AI, emergency response, and real-time pharmacy logistics to make urgent healthcare needs as simple as a tap.

| Team Rayquaza | Sambhaji Nagar | MIT College of Engineering Chha Sambhaji Nagar | PPT - https://pdflink.to/90a2edd5/ 1. Introduction Online pharmacy platforms are becoming common, but most systems still rely on manual user actions and static backend processes. Users must manually search medicines, upload prescriptions, and track refill schedules, which increases friction and health risks. Our project introduces an Agentic AI Pharmacy Assistant that acts like a digital pharmacist. Users interact through a chat or voice interface built with React.js and Web Speech API, while intelligent AI agents orchestrated using LangChain handle reasoning and decision-making in real time. 2. Problem Statement Current pharmacy systems are reactive and lack intelligence in decision-making. Stock checks, prescription validation, and order approvals are often rule-based and not automated at scale. Users frequently forget refills, leading to missed doses and health complications. Additionally, backend workflows such as inventory updates, order fulfillment, and notifications are not integrated with AI reasoning systems. There is also no transparency in AI decisions, which is critical in healthcare applications. 3. Proposed Solution We propose a multi-agent AI-driven pharmacy platform where specialized agents handle conversation understanding, safety validation, refill prediction, and execution tasks. The workflow starts with user input via the frontend, which is processed by LangChain agents. These agents query structured medicine data stored in SQLite and CSV as the source of truth. The backend built with FastAPI validates stock and prescription rules. Once approved, n8n automation workflows handle order fulfillment and notifications. All AI decisions are logged using Langfuse observability, and user health insights are visualized using Chart.js dashboards. 4. Benefits and Impact The system improves medication adherence through proactive refill prediction and reminders. Automated stock validation and prescription enforcement enhance patient safety. Backend automation reduces operational overhead for pharmacies. Observability ensures transparency and traceability of AI decisions, increasing trust in AI-driven healthcare systems. This solution demonstrates how agentic AI can enable autonomous, intelligent, and scalable pharmacy operations. 5. Implementation Plan The system is designed as a seamless flow where user interaction, AI reasoning, and backend execution work together as one intelligent pipeline. Users interact with the assistant through a simple chat or voice-based interface, where the AI interprets their intent and extracts medicine-related details. Behind the scenes, autonomous agents evaluate safety rules, analyze past usage patterns, and decide whether an order can proceed or if a refill reminder should be triggered. Once an action is approved, the system automatically synchronizes with the backend to update inventory and simulate real-world fulfillment workflows. Every AI decision is tracked to ensure transparency and accountability, while a lightweight dashboard provides insights into medicine usage trends and proactive alerts. This approach allows the system to demonstrate a realistic, end-to-end intelligent pharmacy workflow rather than just a static prototype. 6. Conclusion The Agentic AI Pharmacy Assistant showcases a futuristic, autonomous pharmacy system that integrates conversational AI, predictive analytics, backend automation, and decision traceability. By transforming manual pharmacy workflows into intelligent agent-driven processes, this project highlights the future of AI-powered healthcare platforms and digital pharmacists |  |  |
| Team Luxray | Nanded | Shri Guru Gobind Singhji Institute of Engineering and Technology | Our platform is an end-to-end autonomous pharmacy ecosystem designed to transform traditional pharmaceutical services into a proactive, intelligent healthcare experience. At its core, the system utilizes a multi-agent orchestration framework(LangGraph & LangChain) powered by Python-based NLP and OCR to simulate a human pharmacist’s reasoning. The system integrates voice- and-text conversational Chatbot with automated prescription validation, real-time inventory synchronization, and a personalized medication adherence engine. Unlike traditional platforms, our platform acts autonomously, it notifies pharmacists of new requests, validates safety protocols, predicts exact refill dates, and even learns a user’s daily routine to provide hyper-personalized medication reminders, all while ensuring 100% observability through LangSmith. The workflow begins with a voice or text-based consultation. Users can speak naturally to the Chatbot, which uses NLP to extract dosages and quantities. Simultaneously, an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) pipeline parses uploaded physical prescriptions. The system cross references the extracted text with the image data to ensure 100% accuracy and regulatory compliance before a single order is processed. Using LangGraph, the system manages complex, stateful workflows. If a user requests a medicine, the platform doesn't just check a database, it autonomously verifies safety protocols, checks contraindications, and validates the prescription's expiration. This "Chain of Thought" is logged via LangSmith, providing the transparency and auditability required by modern healthcare standards. The system functions as a digital health guardian by tracking Customer Purchase History. By calculating the daily dosage against the quantity purchased, our platform estimates the exact date a user will run out of medication. It then proactively sends a notification to the user and allows"one-click reorder" and alerts the pharmacist if the any item falls below buffer stock levels, ensuring the supply chain never breaks. Beyond ordering, the platform acts as a personalized health coach. By cross-referencing doctor-prescribed frequencies (e.g., "twice daily after meals") with user-provided routine data (e.g., typical lunch/dinner times), the platform autonomously predicts the optimal window for notifications. It doesn't just send a generic alert it analyzes the medicine's specific requirements to remind the user when to eat, and subsequently, when to take their medication, ensuring maximum efficiency and safety.

This project proposes an Agentic AI-powered Autonomous Pharmacy System that redefines digital pharmacy operations by simulating the reasoning, decision-making, and proactive behavior of an expert pharmacist, while autonomously executing backend operations with minimal human intervention. The system introduces a multi-agent architecture capable of understanding natural human conversations (text and voice) to extract medicine names, dosages, frequency, and quantities from unstructured, real-world dialogue. A dedicated Policy & Safety Enforcement Agent uses a provided Medicine Master dataset (Excel/CSV) as the single source of truth to validate orders against stock availability, prescription requirements, and regulatory constraints, ensuring compliance and patient safety. To move beyond reactive systems, a Predictive Intelligence Agent analyzes historical consumer purchase data to estimate medicine consumption patterns and proactively identifies refill requirements. When a potential shortage or refill window is detected, the system autonomously initiates alerts or refill conversations, improving medication adherence and user convenience. The platform emphasizes real-world actionability through autonomous backend execution. Upon approval, the system updates inventory, records transactions in a mock database, and triggers warehouse fulfillment requests via webhooks, with optional automated notifications through email or WhatsApp channels. To ensure transparency and trust in autonomous decision-making, the system integrates an observability layer that logs end-to-end agent interactions and decision traces, enabling judges and stakeholders to inspect the Chain of Thought behind every approval, rejection, or action. A minimal yet functional chat-based user interface with voice input support enables seamless interaction, while an admin dashboard provides real-time visibility into inventory status, proactive refill alerts, and system actions. Built using modern web technologies and a mock backend API, the proposed solution demonstrates how agentic AI can safely, intelligently, and autonomously manage healthcare workflows. This project showcases a scalable and industry-relevant approach to intelligent pharmacy automation, combining conversational AI, policy enforcement, predictive analytics, and autonomous execution—positioning it as a practical and future-ready solution for next-generation digital healthcare systems. |  |  |

| Team Sylveon | Nanded | Shri Guru Gobind Singhji Institute of Engineering and Technology | Project Title: MediSync Theme: Autonomous Agentic AI System for Pharmacy Ecosystems Abstract MediSync is an autonomous, agentic AI ecosystem designed to move traditional pharmacy workflows away from reactive, search-heavy interfaces toward a proactive, natural-language-driven approach. The platform centers on a distributed multi-agent architecture orchestrated through a directed acyclic graph (DAG) using LangGraph. This setup provides deterministic state management, which supports complex multi-turn reasoning and smooth handoffs between specialized agents. The system uses advanced Natural Language Understanding (NLU) to interpret unstructured vocal and textual inputs, even when they are noisy or ambiguous. It extracts specific clinical entities such as drug names, dosage forms, and volume requirements. A persistent memory layer maintains patient context across sessions, enabling personalized interactions that reference historical preferences, allergies, and adherence patterns. To strengthen clinical compliance, MediSync incorporates a Multimodal Vision-Language Model (VLM) pipeline that cross-references handwritten prescriptions against a centralized SQL-based source of truth for inventory checks and safety validation. This pipeline additionally reconstructs illegible handwritten prescriptions into clean, structured digital formats, presenting both the original and parsed versions for pharmacist verification. Beyond automating transactions, MediSync applies Predictive Temporal Analytics to longitudinal patient data to model when medications are likely to run out. This feeds into an autonomous, event-driven loop that triggers refill processes proactively, helping to improve medication adherence. The technical stack includes a high-concurrency mock backend built with FastAPI for real-time state synchronization, along with an integrated observability layer using Langfuse. This enables detailed, low-latency tracing of the chain of thought behind every decision, surfaced through an interactive visualization that renders agent reasoning pathways, data access logs, and decision logic in real time. This ensures that all autonomous actions remain auditable, transparent, and clinically sound. |  |  |

| Team Magmar | Pune | AISSMS College of Engineering | Abstract: Agentic AI for Autonomous Healthcare Management The Agentic Pharmacy shifts from traditional, passive pharmacy management to an autonomous, intelligent system driven by Generative AI. This project shows how Agentic AI can be used in healthcare. It highlights how autonomous systems can improve operational efficiency and enhance patient safety. Built on a solid architecture using FastAPI and React, the system combines a set of specialized AI Agents to manage complex workflows with minimal human input. At its center is an autonomous "Pharmacist Agent" powered by Llama 3.1 and LangGraph. This agent can understand natural language, perform tool-based actions like real-time inventory verification and order placement, and maintain context during lengthy conversations. Importantly, the system includes a "Guardian Angel" safety layer aimed at preventing medical errors. It uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to check drug interactions against a medical knowledge base. It also conducts real-time allergy checks against patient profiles, effectively blocking harmful orders before they happen. Additionally, a multi-modal computer vision module, powered by Llama 3.2 Vision, allows for the immediate digitization and analysis of physical prescriptions. This feature connects analog medical records with digital workflows. This system acts as a working prototype for the future of "Smart Healthcare," where AI serves not just as a tool but as an active partner in patient care and inventory management.

| Team Crobat | Nanded | Matoshri Pratishthan Group of Institutions, school of engineering | PRESENTATION https://1drv.ms/p/c/c693a2a5bfd7f3ec/IQDovHuJiw3WQLOPvL9W8_YnAYlOwDPzTh-AvASElv2ps1w?e=RwHOjH Digital pharmaceutical services have a lot of problems that make them hard to use. They do not do a good job of getting things done on time. PharmAGI is a system that uses intelligence to help fix these problems. It makes it easier for people to follow the rules they need to when they are getting care. The system uses small programs that work together to make sure things get done correctly and safely. It also tries to figure out what patients will need ahead of time so it can be ready. PharmAGI does this by using small artificial intelligence programs that work together to automate the complicated things that need to be done when people are getting medical care.The Core Methodology The system is on three parts: * Intelligent Intake and Natural Language Understanding: this uses a voice interface like Whisper or Speech To Text to turn what people say into structured clinical data. It finds out the names of medications how much to take and how often to take them without needing someone to fill out a form by hand. * Autonomous Policy Governance: this is like a supervisor that checks every transaction against the Medicine Master Data, which's the source of all truth. It does this by using a system called Tool Calling to make sure everything is correct. Follows the rules. The Core Methodology is important because it helps the system work properly. The system relies on these three parts to function. The Intelligent Intake and Natural Language Understanding and the Autonomous Policy Governance are key, to making the system work. The system makes sure that it follows the "Prescription Required" rules and checks the inventory levels all the time. It does not allow orders that do not meet these rules. The Predictive Refill Intelligence is a tool that looks at orders to figure out when a patient will run out of medication. It uses a formula to do this: it calculates the Expected Depletion Date by adding the date of the last purchase, to the quantity purchased divided by how often the patient takes the medication. The system uses this formula to find out when a patient will run out of medication and then sends a message to refill the prescription before it runs out. This message is sent automatically using Webhooks like n8n or Zapier. The goal of Predictive Refill Intelligence is to make sure that patients always have the medication they need. The system checks the Prescription Required flags and inventory levels to make sure everything is okay. It also looks at the Predictive Refill Intelligence data to find out when patients will need medication. This way the system can send reminders to refill prescriptions on time.Implementation & TraceabilityTo ensure the high-stakes transparency required for medical operations, PharmAGI integrates LangSmith/Langfuse for mandatory observability. This provides a granular, auditable Chain of Thought (CoT) for every decision, documenting the logic handoffs between the Triage, Compliance, and Fulfillment agents. The backend is powered by a high-performance FastAPI infrastructure, ensuring that every AI decision translates into real-world database updates and warehouse triggers. | [Link](https://1drv.ms/p/c/c693a2a5bfd7f3ec/IQDovHuJiw3WQLOPvL9W8_YnAYlOwDPzTh-AvASElv2ps1w?e=RwHOjH) |  |
| Team Haxorus | Nanded | Shri Guru Gobind Singhji Institute of Engineering and Technology | Conventionally, online pharmacy platforms primarily rely on manual user interactions such as search-based queries and click-driven workflows, resulting in limited automation and inadequate safety validation mechanisms. These limitations reduce operational efficiency and increase user workload. To address these challenges, this project proposes an Agentic AI–based pharmacy system that enables autonomous decision-making, safety enforcement, and execution of real-world transactions within a digital pharmacy environment. The primary objectives of the proposed Agentic System are to support natural language–based medicine ordering through text and voice interfaces, utilize a centralized and structured medicines master database as a single source of truth for prescription and stock validation, and analyze historical consumer purchasing data to predict future medicine refill requirements. The system adopts a multi-agent architecture, comprising a conversational agent for intent extraction, safety and policy agents for regulatory compliance, a refill prediction agent for proactive reminders, and action execution agents for automating backend operations. The Agentic System enables medicine ordering using unstructured user inputs, automatically validates prescriptions and inventory availability, generates refill prediction notifications, updates inventory records, and triggers order fulfillment through API-based integrations. An integrated observability layer ensures transparency, traceability, and accountability across agent decisions and actions. The proposed approach demonstrates how Agentic AI can significantly enhance safety, efficiency, and user experience in online pharmacy systems while minimizing human intervention. ppt link : https://1drv.ms/p/c/8619612b25b46388/IQCRZhwsMAmEQp8W5Q3-UrRpAdgObzuqqcU0PyJcJ2Q9jB8?e=aDGhge | [Link](https://1drv.ms/p/c/8619612b25b46388/IQCRZhwsMAmEQp8W5Q3-UrRpAdgObzuqqcU0PyJcJ2Q9jB8?e=aDGhge) |  |
| Team Torterra | Nanded | MGM COE Nanded | Abstract Agentic AI Smart Pharmacy System This project introduces an Agentic AI–based Smart Pharmacy System that transforms a traditional search-and-click pharmacy platform into an autonomous and intelligent healthcare ordering ecosystem. Acting as a virtual pharmacist, the system understands natural voice and text interactions and accurately extracts medicine names, dosages, and quantities even from unstructured or unclear user inputs. It is designed using a multi-agent architecture in which specialized agents collaboratively manage conversational ordering, safety checks, prescription validation, inventory control, proactive refill prediction, and automated order execution. The system relies exclusively on a Medicine Master Excel Sheet as its single source of truth, ensuring strict compliance with real-world constraints such as stock availability and prescription requirements. A key strength of the platform is its ability to support users in emergency situations, rural locations, and medicine shortage scenarios by offering 24/7 guidance and recommending safe alternatives. It also intelligently manages dermatology medicine shortages by suggesting equivalent substitutes and initiating procurement workflows. One of the system’s major innovations is its Pharmacy-Outage Mode, which delivers emergency assistance when pharmacy services are disrupted due to store closures, system downtime, or delivery limitations. During such situations, the AI switches to an emergency mode, recommends safe substitutes, and prepares priority procurement and delivery requests to be executed once operations resume. Additionally, the system incorporates predictive intelligence to analyze customer purchase history and proactively issue refill reminders before medications run out. Upon user confirmation, it autonomously updates inventory, stores orders in a mock database, and triggers real-world fulfillment processes through webhooks or automation tools such as n8n or Zapier, with optional email or WhatsApp notifications. To ensure reliability and transparency, observability tools such as Langfuse and LangSmith are integrated to provide detailed trace logs of agent decision-making. Overall, this solution delivers a safe, proactive, and highly automated pharmacy experience by combining conversational AI, policy enforcement, and intelligent workflow automation. 🔗 PPT / Demo Link: [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fVMN2-Uuh9oJBdXh90hx44vIui6sXD8m/view?usp=drivesdk] Future development will focus on integrating advanced drug-interaction checks, voice-based multilingual support, real-time inventory synchronization, and full end-to-end automation.

| Team Electabuzz | NAGPUR | GHRCEMN | We designed PharmaFlow to fundamentally transform the traditional pharmacy experience from a passive search-and-click interface into a fully autonomous, agentic ecosystem. Our goal was to build a system that doesn't just retrieve information but behaves like an expert pharmacist, capable of understanding natural voice and text conversations while managing complex backend tasks with minimal human intervention. We recognized that real-world patient interactions are rarely structured, so we engineered our agents to handle conversational ordering, allowing them to accurately extract medicine names, dosages, and quantities from messy, human-like dialogue. At the heart of our solution is a commitment to safety and proactive care. PharmaFlow strictly utilizes the provided Medicine Master Data as its absolute Source of Truth, autonomously deciding if an order can proceed by verifying stock levels and enforcing Prescription Required flags in real-time. Beyond just processing current orders, we implemented predictive intelligence capabilities. By analyzing the Mock Customer History, our system identifies which users are running out of medication based on their dosage schedules and proactively initiates refill conversations or alerts, ensuring patients never miss a dose. To prove that our agents can interact with the real world, we moved beyond simple chat responses to actual tool execution. The system is integrated with a custom mock backend API that hosts our data, allowing agents to read inventory and write new orders dynamically. Upon finalizing a transaction, the agent triggers a warehouse fulfillment request via webhooks and manages external communication channels like email or WhatsApp for order confirmations. Because trust is non-negotiable in agentic systems, we integrated a dedicated observability platform to track the Chain of Thought, allowing judges to view the live trace logs of how Agent A communicates with Agent B and the logic behind every approval or rejection.

| Team Yveltal | Nagpur | GHCEMN | This project proposes an agentic AI–powered pharmacy assistant that transforms a traditional search-and-click pharmacy into a proactive autonomous ecosystem. The solution is built around three pillars: a web application as the primary user interface, an Excel-based data layer as the source of truth, and n8n-driven automation to orchestrate real-world workflows. Through a chat-first (and extensible voice) interface, patients can place medicine orders in natural language, while the AI agent extracts drug names, dosages, and quantities from messy, human-like conversations and validates them against a Medicine Master Excel/CSV sheet that stores stock levels, unit types, and prescription-required flags. On the backend, the system exposes the Excel/CSV data (Medicine Master and Consumer Order History) through a mock API layer (e.g., FastAPI or Node.js/Supabase), enabling agents to read inventory, check user history, and write new orders in a structured, auditable manner while keeping pharmacists comfortable with familiar spreadsheet workflows. Using the historical order data and dosage frequency, a predictive module identifies customers who are likely to run out of medicine soon and automatically initiates refill conversations or alerts, reducing non-adherence and improving continuity of care. Once an order is finalized, n8n flows are triggered via webhooks to simulate warehouse fulfillment requests and optionally send confirmation messages over email or WhatsApp, turning agent decisions into end-to-end automated actions. The web app also offers a minimal but focused admin view for pharmacy staff, showing live mock inventory levels, open orders, and proactive refill alerts so humans can intervene when needed. To guarantee trust and transparency, all agent interactions and tool calls are integrated with an observability platform such as Langfuse or LangSmith, providing judges with a public trace log that reveals the full chain of thought and inter-agent communication behind each decision. Overall, this stack—web frontend, Excel-based master data, mock API backend, observability, and n8n workflow automation—demonstrates how a small team can turn a basic online pharmacy into an intelligent, autonomous assistant that is both practical to implement and easy for real pharmacies.

Proactive Refill Agent – Uses a simple machine learning recommendation model to predict upcoming refill needs and automatically trigger reminders through WhatsApp or calls. All agents are orchestrated as part of one unified AI system, supported by a web-based pharmacist dashboard built for live monitoring of orders, inventory health, refill alerts, and transparent AI decision reasoning. Together, this system simplifies pharmacy operations while improving patient adherence and safety. Patients can easily order medicines, receive refill reminders, and get assistance through familiar channels like WhatsApp or phone calls, without creating accounts or installing any applications. Pharmacists benefit from automated order handling, predictive refill insights, and real-time visibility into inventory and AI decisions, allowing them to focus more on care and less on repetitive tasks. The result is a seamless, accessible, and intelligent pharmacy workflow that works for both patients and pharmacists.

| Team Corviknight | Boisar | St John college of Engineering and Management | The global pharmacy industry stands at a critical inflection point: while online pharmacy revenues are projected to reach USD 97–103 billion in 2025 and more than double by 2032–2034, driven by chronic diseases, aging populations, and convenience demands, the sector is crippled by a "silent epidemic" of medication non-adherence. Alarmingly, 27–40% of patients with chronic conditions like hypertension are non-adherent, with up to 50% abandoning treatment within one year, resulting in hundreds of thousands of preventable deaths worldwide and hundreds of billions in avoidable healthcare costs annually. Current online and offline pharmacy platforms operate primarily as transactional catalogue systems—offering search, add-to-cart functionality, and basic reminders—but fundamentally lack continuous intelligent monitoring, proactive refill predictions, expert pharmacist-like decision support across channels, and integrated stakeholder coordination. Compounding these operational gaps, pharmacies, warehouses, and delivery partners function as isolated silos leading to stock imbalances and expiry wastage, while regulators grapple with unsafe online medicine sales, counterfeit drugs, and weak enforcement amid opaque AI systems without chain-of-thought observability. RxCompute AI introduces a breakthrough Agentic AI–powered Virtual Pharmacy Grid that autonomously orchestrates the entire ecosystem through six specialized, seamlessly collaborating AI agents: Conversation Agent (interprets messy voice/text inputs like "Refill my BP medicine for 30 days," extracting details and clarifying ambiguities); Prediction Agent (analyzes order history and dosage schedules to proactively detect low-stock risks and initiate refill conversations); Scheduler Agent (treats pharmacies, warehouses, and delivery partners as unified resource nodes, dynamically routing medicine "jobs" based on real-time stock, expiry risk, cost, and SLA for load balancing and split shipments); Safety and Policy Agents (enforce structured rules from Medicine Master Data and admin-configured policies, autonomously blocking unsafe orders with clear reasoning and escalating high-risk cases to Human-in-the-Loop review); Notification Agent (delivers dynamic, risk-scored interventions across chat, mobile, WhatsApp, and email for prescription expiry and adherence support); and Observability Agent (records every interaction in Langfuse/LangSmith consoles, exposing end-to-end traces—Conversation → Safety → Inventory → Scheduling → Fulfillment—with agent inputs, tool calls, reasoning summaries, and public links for regulator trust). This multi-agent backbone powers role-specific experiences: Users enjoy seamless conversational dashboards with proactive AI (no manual pharmacy selection); Pharmacies receive AI-routed orders, auto-reorder suggestions, and operational cockpits; Admins manage policies, visualize the Virtual Grid, and access governance transparency; Warehouses handle AI-initiated fulfillment queues with tool invocation viewers. Deployed as a full-stack autonomous ecosystem using FastAPI/Supabase backends and Flutter/web UIs, RxCompute directly eliminates all five critical gaps—limited intelligence, fragmented operations, weak safety enforcement, lack of observability, and poor adherence support—delivering a scalable, globally viable solution that slashes non-adherence, optimizes supply chains, ensures regulatory compliance, and transforms pharmacy from a reactive, siloed model into a proactive, intelligent, and fully auditable expert ecosystem. https://www.canva.com/design/DAG9e7wp0WM/geH5TZUaCKjTHyCm27UBOA/edit?utm_content=DAG9e7wp0WM&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link2&utm_source=sharebutton | [Link](https://www.canva.com/design/DAG9e7wp0WM/geH5TZUaCKjTHyCm27UBOA/edit?utm_content=DAG9e7wp0WM&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link2&utm_source=sharebutton) |  |
| Team Pikachu | jalna | MSS POLYTECHNIC JALNA | Title: AI-Assisted Pharmacy Ordering and Inventory Support System Abstract: In many local pharmacies, medicine ordering, stock management, and refill tracking are still handled manually, which often leads to stock shortages, delayed refills, and increased workload for pharmacists. Patients also face inconvenience in repeatedly requesting medicines, especially for long-term treatments. This project proposes an AI-assisted pharmacy support system that helps pharmacists manage patient requests, inventory status, and refill reminders in a simple and controlled manner. Instead of fully automating decisions, the system works as an assistant that supports pharmacists while keeping them in full control of approvals and stock handling. Patients can submit medicine requests through a simple chat or form-based interface. These requests are sent to the pharmacist’s dashboard, where they can be accepted, rejected, or modified based on availability and prescription requirements. The system also provides basic refill suggestions using past request data and generates low-stock alerts to help pharmacists prepare orders in advance. The proposed solution focuses on practicality, safety, and ease of use, making it suitable for real-world pharmacy environments. It improves operational efficiency without disrupting existing workflows and avoids over-complex automation, ensuring reliability and scalability for future enhancements.

| Team Zacian | Mangalore | St Joseph Engineering College, Vamanjoor | Modern healthcare struggles with fragmented personal health records. Outdated paper systems and siloed databases often delay emergency care and contribute to 18% of medical errors. Although standards like FHIR and HL7 exist, poor interoperability prevents smooth data sharing. Centralized storage gives patients little control over their own data, fueling a 93% rise in breaches and costing the U.S. $12 billion annually. While current EHR systems favor institutions, emerging solutions like blockchain and zero-knowledge proofs face regulatory hurdles like GDPR, leaving the core issue unresolved: ensuring patient-controlled, secure, and accessible health data.

| Team Vaporeon | Mangalore | St Joseph Engineering College | Current online pharmacy platforms are largely transactional: users search for a product, place an order, and the interaction ends. While this mirrors how many real-world pharmacies operate, it lacks structured clinical reasoning, proactive intervention, and traceable decision-making at scale. This project explores how an online pharmacy can emulate the reasoning workflows of a trained pharmacist rather than merely acting as an e-commerce interface. The system is implemented using multiple AI agents, each responsible for a specific task. A conversational agent interprets natural language and voice inputs, including incomplete medicine names or unclear dosage requests. This is followed by a policy and safety agent that consults a Medicine Master dataset to validate stock availability, prescription requirements, and safety constraints before issuing an approval or rejection decision. To move beyond reactive ordering, the system incorporates an ARIMA-based time series model to analyze historical purchase data and predict future medicine demand. It also estimates medication depletion timelines based on dosage patterns, enabling proactive refill reminders and user engagement. The system executes backend actions rather than only generating responses. Approved orders update inventory records, log transactions, and trigger warehouse fulfillment via webhook workflows. A chat-based interface is provided for users, while an admin dashboard offers visibility into inventory levels and predictive refill alerts. An observability layer tracks agent interactions, decisions, and tool invocations, enabling end-to-end traceability of system reasoning and backend actions. This allows developers and administrators to understand why decisions were made and which data sources informed them. Overall, the project focuses on building a scalable, transparent, and proactive pharmacy intelligence system rather than a traditional search-and-click platform. |  |  |
| Team Leafeon | Jalna | Mss college of Engineering & Technology | 1. Problem Statement Pharmacies today face major challenges in managing medicine ordering, refill scheduling, and inventory forecasting. Most existing systems depend on manual processes, fixed reorder cycles, and user-initiated search-based ordering. Chronic patients often forget refills, leading to treatment gaps, while pharmacies suffer from overstocking or stock-outs due to inaccurate demand prediction. Additionally, pharmacists are burdened with repetitive tasks such as order verification, refill reminders, and procurement planning. There is a lack of intelligent systems that can understand natural customer intent, predict medicine consumption, and autonomously manage end-to-end pharmacy workflows. ________________________________________ 2. Existing Solutions & Their Limitations Current digital pharmacy platforms provide basic online ordering and reminder functionalities. Users must manually search for medicines, add them to carts, and place orders. Refill reminders, if available, are rule-based and generic, lacking personalization. Inventory management systems operate independently from customer behaviour and require human intervention for procurement decisions. Limitations: • No natural language or conversational ordering • No accurate prediction of medicine depletion • High dependency on pharmacists for manual verification • Lack of automation in backend procurement workflows • Poor reflection of real patient consumption behaviour ________________________________________ 3. Proposed Solution We propose an Smart Pharmacy System for Medicine Ordering and Refill Management that automates pharmacy operations using conversational AI, predictive intelligence, and multi-agent systems. Customers can order medicines using natural voice or text interaction. The system intelligently understands medicine names, quantities, and prescriptions, predicts refill requirements based on historical consumption, and autonomously prepares backend procurement workflows. A multi-agent architecture ensures safe, efficient, and scalable pharmacy management with minimal human intervention. ________________________________________ 4. Methodology The system is implemented using the following methodology: 1. Conversational-Ordering-Module A natural language assistant enables users to order medicines via chat or voice, extract medicine details, and generate an order summary. 2. Predictive-Intelligence-Engine Historical order data is analysed to learn consumption patterns and calculate estimated medicine depletion dates. 3. Multi-Agent Architecture o Ordering Agent: Handles customer interaction o Forecast Agent: Predicts refill and inventory needs o Safety Agent: Validates prescriptions and interactions o Procurement Agent: Prepares automated purchase workflows 4. Workflow-Automation-Integration Automation tools trigger notifications, update inventory systems, and initiate supplier communication. ________________________________________ 5. Result / Expected Outcome The proposed system significantly reduces manual workload for pharmacists while improving customer experience through intelligent and proactive interactions. It ensures timely medicine availability, minimizes missed refills, prevents stock-outs, and enhances patient safety. The solution demonstrates how agentic AI can enable scalable, autonomous pharmacy operations suitable for real-world deployment. |  | Problem Statement \| Existing Solutions & Their Limitations \| No natural language or conversational ordering \| No accurate prediction of medicine depletion \| High dependency on pharmacists for manual verification \| Lack of automation in backend procurement workflows \| Poor reflection of real patient consumption behaviour \| Proposed Solution \| Methodology \| Conversational-Ordering-Module |

It is designed to behave like an expert pharmacist — interpreting natural language (text or voice), enforcing safety and prescription rules, predicting medicine refill needs, and autonomously executing backend tasks such as inventory updates and fulfillment actions — with minimal human intervention. Pulse addresses core challenges faced by both customers and pharmacies by supporting a wide range of access modes, including: ⦁ A React-based Progressive Web Application (PWA) for rich, interactive conversational ordering. ⦁ SMS fallback for users without smartphones or reliable internet. ⦁ Voice interaction for users who prefer or require spoken communication. Session handoffs are seamless between these channels, ensuring continuity even if network connectivity changes during an interaction. The heart of Pulse is its Agentic Orchestration Core, implemented using structured multi-agent coordination. The core reads user inputs, classifies intent, and routes requests to specialized agents that handle conversational state, clinical reasoning, inventory and sales logic, policy validation, and proactive alerts. High-risk or ambiguous cases can be escalated to a human pharmacist for review, ensuring safety and compliance. Real-time decisions and transitions between agents are logged and made observable using a traceability platform, providing judges with a clear “chain of thought” for audit and evaluation. The system integrates with a mock backend built on the MERN stack: ⦁ Frontend: React Progressive Web App for interactive user engagement. ⦁ Backend: Node.js with Express for API endpoints. ⦁ Database: MongoDB for persistent inventory, history, and structured data. ⦁ Telephony & Messaging: Twilio to handle voice calls and SMS gateways. ⦁ Natural Intelligence: An LLM-driven language understanding layer for intent extraction and contextual interpretation. ⦁ Observability: A trace log platform that records agent interactions and decision paths. Pulse supports full workflow automation, including inventory updates, webhook-based fulfillment requests, and automated order confirmations via SMS or email. Its design ensures inclusive access for users regardless of device capabilities or digital literacy while maintaining robust safety, compliance, and observable decision logic throughout the healthcare journey.
